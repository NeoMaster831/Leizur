Leizur is open-source osu!lazer cheat, is under development. After completing development, it'll be switched to private.

# Requirements

As osu anticheat is on usermode, you can realize that if you go kernel, it'll be bypassed.
So I did. To read process' memory, we use Hooked-`NtQueryCompositionSurfaceStatistics`.

To use, you'll need to check out [this](https://github.com/NeoMaster831/rwDriver).

Also, it uses DirectX 9 and GDI+, if you can't run you should check those.

# How to use

Go project, build, and use. It requires [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ko/vs/).
